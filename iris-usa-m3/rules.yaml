		Briefing: The Iris War - U.S.A. - Epilogue Mission 3: New Advancements\n\nThanks to the contributions of the three Councils as well as the technology stolen from the three main armies in the war, the new alliance has developed a new unmanned battle tank that could be mass-produced at a cheap cost. Many of them have found practical use already, but this will be their first major test. To help the Council of Sankalpa establish a dedicated facility, you will need to punch through a Nitro Orthodoxy production facility in the region. You should have no problem with some drones at your disposal.\n\nObjective 1: Destroy the Nitro production facility.\nObjective 2: Defend the area from the oncoming Nitro counterattack.
